# turing-machine

A Turing machine simulator written in Javascript, with a graphical user interface.\
Everything is in one file (turingMachine.html), so that to try it out it is sufficient to download it and open it with a web browser.\
An example machine (the second example from Turing's paper) is initially loaded.
